# **Data Structures Visualization Using SFML**

## **Overview**
This project is an interactive application to visualize various data structures using the **SFML** library. Users can:
- Select a data structure from a menu.
- Perform operations like insertion, deletion, and file import.
- *(Currently in progress)* Visualize the selected data structure.

While the menu and operations are functional, the visual representation of the ADTs is under development due to time constraints.

---

## **Features**
### **Implemented Data Structures**
- AVL Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Red-Black Tree
- B-Tree
- Heap
- Stack and Queue
- Priority Queue

### **Functional Menu**
- Allows users to select an ADT and perform basic operations.

### **File Import**
- Load data for ADTs from a file.

---

## **Challenges**
The visual representation of ADTs through SFML is incomplete. Users can still interact with the menu, perform operations, and test functionality through console outputs.

## **How to Build and Run**

### **Prerequisites**

- A C++17-compatible compiler.
- Git for cloning the repository.

### **Setup Instructions**

#### **Clone the repository**:
```bash
